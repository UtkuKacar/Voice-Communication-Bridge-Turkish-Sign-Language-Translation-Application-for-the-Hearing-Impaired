# Voice Communication Bridge Turkish Sign Language Translation Application for the Hearing Impaired

This project is designed to recognize and translate Turkish Sign Language (TSL) gestures into text. The project utilizes computer vision and machine learning techniques to interpret hand gestures captured through a camera, facilitating communication for individuals who use sign language.

## Project Overview

The Turkish Sign Language Recognition project aims to develop a model capable of accurately identifying TSL gestures and converting them into readable text. This tool can be integrated into various applications, such as mobile or web platforms, to assist in real-time communication.

## Features

- **Real-time Gesture Detection**: Recognizes TSL gestures in real-time from camera input.
- **Translation to Text**: Converts recognized gestures directly into Turkish text.
- **Model Training**: Includes dataset preparation, model training, and testing.
- **Custom Dataset**: Utilizes a dataset tailored for Turkish Sign Language gestures.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Keras (if used for model training)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TSL-Recognition-Project.git
   cd TSL-Recognition-Project
